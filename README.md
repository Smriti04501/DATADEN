## Project Approach:

**Week 1 (4th-8th May):-** Explored the problem statement and decided on the tech stack to be used.

**Week 2 (9th-14th May):** Worked on analyzing the dataset and created the basic environment to display plots, statistical insights and the 'Report' feature for the application.

**Week 3 (15th-21st May):** Worked on the UI/UX of the application and added some additional static and functional features such as the Notetaker.

**Week 4 (22nd-27th May):** Worked on the *X factor feature (CO2 emissions in cars)* and improving the overall website. Deployed the website and created the video demonstration.


## What's next for the app?

- Accept multiple file types other than csv (for eg: excel)
- Sharing the live visualization dashboards after the analysis
- User Interface and User Experience upgradation
- Introduction of more variety of plot types for analysis
